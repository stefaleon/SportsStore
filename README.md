### 00 Create an empty MVC Project

* Create an empty project using the ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core) template. Ensure that .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.0
are selected in the menus at the top of the dialog window.


&nbsp;
### 01 Basic MVC boilerplate

* Add the *Models*, *Controllers* and *Views* folders.
* Edit *Startup.cs*.
* Add -> New Item -> Razor View Imports and edit the *_ViewImports.cshtml*.


&nbsp;
### 02 Add the unit testing project

* Add -> New Project -> xUnit Test Project (.NET Core) -> SportsStore.Tests 
* In SportsStore.Tests dependencies, add a reference to SportsStore.csproj.
* Add the *Moq* package.


&nbsp;
### 03 Start the Domain Model

* Add the *Product* class.
* Add the *IProductRepository* interface. It uses `IQueryable<T>` to allow a caller to obtain a sequence of Product objects. The `IQueryable<T>` interface is derived from the more familiar `IEnumerable<T>` interface and represents a collection of objects that can be queried, such as those managed by a database.


&nbsp;
### 04 Creating a Fake Repository

* Add the *FakeProductRepository* class, which inherits from *IProductRepository*.
It implements the *IProductRepository* interface by returning a fixed collection of *Product* objects as the value of the *Products* property. The *AsQueryable* method is used to convert the fixed collection of objects to an *IQueryable<Product>*, which is required to implement the *IProductRepository* interface and allows to create a compatible fake repository without having to deal with real queries.
